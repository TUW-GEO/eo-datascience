title: Harmonic Parameters of Sentinel 1 Backscatter Time Series
jupyter: harmonic-parameters
---


In this notebook, we will show the concept of extracting coefficients that describe seasonal patterns in Sentinel 1 radar backscatter variability. Namely, sine and cosine functions as harmonic oscillators are used to describe periodicities in the time series of, either VV or VH polarisations, backscatter. Those can then be removed from time series and what is left would generally be the noise or transient events, for example floods, volcano erruptions, and whatever is possible to detect with radar Earth Observation data.

Loading sigma nought time series.

```{python}
timeseries_dc = xr.open_dataset(
    "simplecache::zip:///::https://huggingface.co/datasets/martinschobben/tutorials/resolve/main/harmonic-parameters.zarr.zip",  # noqa

The data that is loaded represents VV and VH backsatter polarisations, as detected by Sentinel-1 radar instrument. The two points of interest are on Sicily, nearby Lentini and Catania.

```{python}
latmin, latmax = 37.283606, 37.40621527385254
lonmin, lonmax = 14.826223, 15.109736519516783

bounding_box = [
    [latmin, lonmin],
    [latmax, lonmax],
]

map = folium.Map(
    location=[
        (latmin + latmax) / 2,
        (lonmin + lonmax) / 2,
    ],

lake_plot = lake_curve * event_line
land_plot = land_curve * event_line

(lake_plot + land_plot).cols(1)
```

## The Concept of Harmonic Parameters

### One Harmonic in Traditional Form
A single harmonic is an oscillatory function, which can be expressed as:

$$ f(t) = A \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{n} t + \phi \right) $$

where:
- $ A $ is the **amplitude** of the harmonic,
- $ \phi $ is the **phase shift** in radians,
- $ n $ is the **period** in units of time,
- $ 2\pi/n $ **angular frequency**.

The amplitude here can represent a physical quantitiy of interest, for instance temperature, radar backscatter, soil moisture, etc. In a way, anything can be represented as signal and signal processing can be therefore applied to many different scientific fields.

```{python}
# A simple harmonic oscillator

time = np.linspace(0, 300, 2000)
amplitude = 1.0
period = 20.0
phi = 0.0
y = amplitude * np.cos((2 * np.pi / period) * time + phi)

hv.Curve((time, y), "Time", "Amplitude").opts(
    title="Simple Cosine Plot", width=1000, height=600, line_width=2
)
```

Now, if we have measure a physical quantity over a long time period, for example temperature of some region, we have a time series. A harmonic regression is a least-square-fit of a harmonic function to the complex signal - or time series. In regard to microwave backscattering time series this property can be utilized to represent seasonal patterns caused by vegetation. This way we can filter out the vegetation signal from our microwave backscattering time series - to either better understand the physics behind this harmonic or to better detect events that don't seasonally repeat, like flood events.

Harmonic parameters would be input parameters that define such fitted harmonic components, in this case: amplitude, shifting phase and period of an oscillating function. However, the period and starting phase are inside the non-linear (sinusoidal) function, so a linearisation has to be done, as those parameters are going to be estimated with a least-square regression algorithm. In our case we will only estimate phase shift and amplitude, not the period of the harmonics.

Using the angle sum identity:

$$ \cos(x + y) = \cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y $$

we expand:

$$ A \cos \left( \frac{2\pi t}{n} + \phi \right) = A \left[ \cos \phi \cos \left( \frac{2\pi t}{n} \right) - \sin \phi \sin \left( \frac{2\pi t}{n} \right) \right] $$


#### Defining Coefficients $ c_i $ and $ s_i $

Now, we can define the coefficients, that have units of a physical quantity (amplitude, such as radar backscatter cross sections):

$$ c = A \cos \phi, \quad s = - A \sin \phi $$

so that the equation becomes:

$$ A \cos \left( \frac{2\pi t}{n} + \phi \right) = c \cdot \cos \left( \frac{2\pi t}{n} \right) + s \cdot \sin \left( \frac{2\pi t}{n} \right) $$

We can then extract the starting phase information outside of the sinusoidal function. The period information is still there, but only because in this case it is not estimated in least-square process, but predetermined.

#### Generalizing to $ k $ Harmonics

A complex signal is generally summation of many basic harmonic terms. Summing over all harmonics, we obtain:

$$ f(t) = f^0 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left[ c_i \cos \left( \frac{2\pi i t}{n} \right) + s_i \sin \left( \frac{2\pi i t}{n} \right) \right] $$

where:

- $ f^0 $ is the **mean function value**,
- $ c_i = A_i \cos \phi_i $ and $ s_i = - A_i \sin \phi_i $ are the **harmonic coefficients**.

In this form different periodicities are covered, for example with $ i = 1, 2, ... k $, we can have periods of $ \frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n} $, and so on.

```{python}
# Simulation of complex signal with many harmonics

t = np.linspace(0, 15, 1000)
k = 3

coefficients = [
    {"A": 3, "B": 2, "n": 2, "phi": 0},
    {"A": 1.5, "B": 0.5, "n": 5, "phi": np.pi / 4},
    {"A": 0.8, "B": 1.2, "n": 8, "phi": np.pi / 2},
]

colors = ["firebrick", "navy", "seagreen"]

harmonics = []
signal_sum = np.zeros_like(t)

for coeff in coefficients:
    harmonic = coeff["A"] * np.cos(
        (2 * np.pi * coeff["n"] * t) / 10 + coeff["phi"]
    ) + coeff["B"] * np.sin((2 * np.pi * coeff["n"] * t) / 10 + coeff["phi"])
    harmonics.append(harmonic)
    signal_sum += harmonic

max_amp = max(np.max(np.abs(h)) for h in harmonics + [signal_sum])

fig, axes = plt.subplots(k + 1, 1, figsize=(6, 8), sharex=True)

for i in range(k):
    axes[i].plot(t, harmonics[i], label=f"Harmonic {i + 1}", color=colors[i])
    axes[i].legend()
    axes[i].grid()
    axes[i].set_ylim(-max_amp, max_amp)

axes[k].plot(
    t,
    signal_sum,
    label="Summed Signal = Harmonic 1 + Harmonic 2 + Harmonic 3",
    color="black",
)
axes[k].legend()
axes[k].grid()
axes[k].set_xlabel("Time")
axes[k].set_ylim(-max_amp, max_amp)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Recovering Amplitude and Phase

Now that we have estimated the harmonic coefficients **$ c_i $** and **$ s_i $** wit the harmonic regression, we can recover the **original amplitude and phase** for a physical interpretation, as:

$$ A_i = \sqrt{c_i^2 + s_i^2} $$

$$ \phi_i = \tan^{-1} \left( -\frac{s_i}{c_i} \right) $$

### Harmonic Model Equation for Radar Backscatter in Flood Detection Algorithm

The harmonic model function is given by:

$$
\widehat{\sigma}^0 (t_{doy}) = \sigma^0 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left\{ c_i \cos \left( \frac{2\pi i }{n} t_{doy} \right) + s_i \sin \left( \frac{2\pi i}{n} t_{doy} \right) \right\}
$$

where:

$$
\sigma^0 &\quad \text{is the effective mean radar backscatter,} \\
\widehat{\sigma}^0 (t_{doy}) &\quad \text{is the estimated radar backscatter at time } t, \\
t_{doy} &\quad \text{is the time instance (as a day of a year),} \\
n &= 365 \text{ days} \\
c_i, s_i &\quad \text{are harmonic coefficients for } i = 1, 2, ..., k, \\
k &\quad \text{is the number of harmonic iterations}.
$$


Let's define a function that will fit a model like this with a least squares method, on a `xarray` array. Of course, the initial harmonic parameters first need to be estimated or known and their number depends on $k$.

```{python}
def build_initial_parameters(array, k):
    """

    with option to choose number of k harmonics. Needed for

    param_names = ["mean"]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):

    p0 = {"mean": mean_val}
    for name in param_names[1:]:
        p0[name] = 1.0

    return param_names, p0
```

```{python}

        )

    return result
```

### Harmonic Function Fitting

Now, the two time series can be selected and the coefficients can be estimated.
We pick the VV polarisation for a land pixel and 3 harmonics (7 parameters).

```{python}
land_VV_series = timeseries_dc.sel(point="land").VH
param_names, p0 = build_initial_parameters(land_VV_series, k=3)

fit_result = land_VV_series.curvefit(
    coords="time.dayofyear",
    func=harmonic_model,
    param_names=param_names,
    reduce_dims="time",
)

fit_result
```

Let's extract and print estimated harmonic parameters for this pixel

```{python}
estimated_params = fit_result.curvefit_coefficients.values

for name, val in zip(fit_result.param.values, estimated_params):
    print(f"{name: >6}: {val: .4f}")
```

Now, these coefficient can be used to construct a total harmonic signal.

```{python}
# Extract estimated harmonic parameters and reconstruct a signal as xarray dataaray

mean = estimated_params[0]
coeffs = estimated_params[1:]

fitted_vals = harmonic_model(timeseries_dc["time.dayofyear"], mean, *coeffs)

fitted_da = xr.DataArray(
    fitted_vals, coords={"time": land_VV_series.time}, dims="time", name="Harmonic Fit"
)

# Plot the data

plot = land_VV_series.hvplot(
    label="Original", color="forestgreen", alpha=1
) * fitted_da.hvplot(label="Harmonic Fit", color="darkorange", line_width=2.5)

plot.opts(
    title="Harmonic Model Fit to VV Timeseries over Land",
    xlabel="Time",
    ylabel="VV backscatter",
    width=900,
    height=400,
)
```

We can see cycles that happen once a year, twice a year and three times a year, so it makes sense to work with time series over several years. Important parameter is a number of observations (NOBS) - the more observations the better. It directly relates to the uncertainty of our estimate. In this respect, the standard deviation is an important parameter, as it tells us how well our harmonic function fits the observations. It does not, however, tell us the uncertainty of the observations, just how well they align with seasonal patterns defined by the model.

```{python}
residuals_land = land_VV_series - fitted_da
sse = np.sum(residuals_land.dropna(dim="time").values ** 2)

nobs = residuals_land.size
dof = nobs - (2 * k + 1)

stdev = np.sqrt(sse / dof)

print(f"Number of observations (NOBS): {nobs}")
print(f"Estimated standard deviation of the fit: {stdev: .4f}")
```

Lets plot residuals that were used to calculate standard deviation and see the possible outliers that do not fit those seasonal patterns.

```{python}
land_residuals_ts = residuals_land.dropna(dim="time")
land_residuals_ts.name = "Residual"

land_residuals_ts.hvplot(
    label="Residuals",
    color="firebrick",
    line_width=2,
    title="Residuals of Harmonic Fit (Land Pixel)",
    xlabel="Time",
    ylabel="Residual (VV)",
    width=900,
    height=300,
) * event_line
```

#### Lake Lentini Example

Lets see how time summed harmonic signal looks like for a lake pixel, where backscatter is more stable. Therefore, vegetation periodicities should be less pronounced over water.

```{python}
lake_VV_series = timeseries_dc.sel(point="lake").VV
param_names_lake, p0_lake = build_initial_parameters(lake_VV_series, k=3)

fit_result = lake_VV_series.curvefit(
    coords="time", func=harmonic_model, p0=p0_lake, param_names=param_names_lake
)

estimated_params_lake = fit_result.curvefit_coefficients.values

for name, val in zip(fit_result.param.values, estimated_params_lake):
    print(f"{name: >6}: {val: .4f}")
```

```{python}
mean = estimated_params_lake[0]
coeffs = estimated_params_lake[1:]

fitted_vals = harmonic_model(timeseries_dc["time.dayofyear"], mean, *coeffs)

fitted_da = xr.DataArray(
    fitted_vals, coords={"time": lake_VV_series.time}, dims="time", name="Harmonic Fit"
)

plot = lake_VV_series.hvplot(
    label="Original", color="navy", alpha=0.75
) * fitted_da.hvplot(label="Harmonic Fit", color="darkorange", line_width=2.5)

plot.opts(
    title="Harmonic Model Fit to VV Timeseries of a pixel inside lake Lentini",
    xlabel="Time",
    ylabel="VV backscatter",
    width=900,
    height=400,
)
```

```{python}
residuals_lake = lake_VV_series - fitted_da
sse = np.sum(residuals_lake.dropna(dim="time").values ** 2)

nobs = residuals_lake.size
dof = nobs - (2 * k + 1)

stdev = np.sqrt(sse / dof)

print(f"Number of observations (NOBS): {nobs}")
print(f"Estimated standard deviation of the fit: {stdev: .4f}")
```

```{python}
lake_residuals_ts = residuals_lake.dropna(dim="time")
lake_residuals_ts.name = "Residual"

lake_residuals_ts.hvplot(
    label="Residuals",
    color="firebrick",
    line_width=2,
    title="Residuals of Harmonic Fit (Lake Pixel)",
    xlabel="Time",
    ylabel="Residual (VV)",
    width=900,
    height=300,
)
```

As one can notice, general pattern is a more stochastic signal. One can argue that setting `k = 3` actually introduces artifacts, as the original signal was not periodic in the first place.

### Overfitting Problem - Choosing $k$ iterations

Parameter $k$ that governs the number of harmonic terms, is usually two or three. Higher order terms would lead to overfitting. A flood event in time series would be an impulse (jump in backscatter value) that would propagate as an artefact if higher order harmonics are fitted to years-long time series. Higher order terms would usually have low amplitude, an estimation of those would highly depend on noise level in signal. Therefore, those harmonics would not be of a physical nature, or in other words, they wouldn't represent seasonal vegetation cycles.

```{python}
ks = [1, 2, 3, 10]
fitted_das = []

for k in ks:
    param_names, p0 = build_initial_parameters(land_VV_series, k)

    fit_result = land_VV_series.curvefit(
        coords="time.dayofyear",
        func=harmonic_model,
        param_names=param_names,
        reduce_dims="time",
    )

    estimated_params = fit_result.curvefit_coefficients.values
    mean = estimated_params[0]
    coeffs = estimated_params[1:]
    fitted_vals = harmonic_model(timeseries_dc["time.dayofyear"], mean, *coeffs)

    fitted_da = xr.DataArray(
        fitted_vals,
        coords={"time": land_VV_series.time},
        dims="time",
        name=f"Harmonic Fit (k={k})",
    )
    fitted_das.append(fitted_da)

plot = land_VV_series.hvplot(label="Original", color="black", alpha=0.6)

colors = ["red", "orange", "green", "blue"]

for da, k_val, color in zip(fitted_das, ks, colors):
    plot *= da.hvplot(label=f"k = {k_val}", line_width=2, color=color)

plot.opts(
    title="Harmonic Fits of VV Timeseries for Multiple k Values",
    xlabel="Time",
    ylabel="VV Backscatter",
    width=900,
    height=400,
    legend_position="top_left",
)
```
