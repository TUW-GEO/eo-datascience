This is a book on Earth Observation Datascience, consisting of common workflows in Python at the Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation at the TU Wien (Vienna Austria).

The workflows comprise exercises that utilize remote sensing information, such as microwave backscattering from Sentinel-1 and visible range imagery from Sentinel-2.

This project is the development side of the accompanying [Project Pythia EO Data Science Cookbook](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/eo-datascience-cookbook).

## Quarto

This book is based on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a literate programming system for open-source scientific and technical documents.
